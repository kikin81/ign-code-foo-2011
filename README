Bio:
  I am really exited to hear that there is a possiblility for me to work for IGN.
I got introduced to IGN when I was yough because as a gamer I would search for walkthroughs
that would help me complete games to 100%. To my understanding I know that IGN has expanded and
do more than just rate, review, and preview games. It would be an honor and pleasure to help
IGN expand its horizons.

  I am a gamer and have earned my degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the University
of California Merced. I have taken a couple of courses about video games, web design and database,
among others. I have also worked for a year now with the school. At my job we began using the Php
Zend Framework. I have found the Model View Controller design to keep my code organized and
"modualized." Within this project I have learned a deal of CSS, javascript and jqueryui to make
designs that are user intituive.

	It would be my pleasure to work with your company and learn the insight of video games
and I would love to learn what other things you do.
